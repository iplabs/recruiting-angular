# Simple Picture Viewer
## Task
Complete this Angular app. The goal is to have 2 simple pages.
First, an overview page showing a list of pictures, sorted by id. Clicking on a picture should direct to the second page, a detail page. On this page some details about the selected picture should be provided, the user should be able to change the size of the preview picture and should also be able to remove the picture.
The data to create the picture-list from is located at `src/app/iplabs/imageData.ts`.
This data may not be modified, only loaded.
There should be no errors appearing on the console throughout the use of the application.
